The high level for this solution: We create a graph and prereq dict to track which nodes we have visited and if we're able to travel to certain nodes (if there are no preqs for the intended next course - aka we've taken the prereqs or there are no prereqs.).
Eg. 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Starting: q: deque([0])
preqs: {0: set(), 1: {0}, 2: {0}, 3: {1, 2}}
graph: {0: {1, 2}, 1: {3}, 2: {3}}
We start with course 0 because it has no preqs.
Looking at our graph, 0 has 2 neighbors 1 and 2
We check 1 and 2 to see that if we have taken course 0 whether we can take them.
We determine this by removing 0 (course we have taken) from 1 and 2's prereqs and if there are no additional prereqs we take them (add them to our queue).
After taking 0, 1 and 2 added: deque([1, 2])
1 and 2 added because they are neighbors (from our graph): {0: {1, 2}, 1: {3}, 2: {3}})
And after taking course 0 now have no prereqs: {0: set(), 1: set(), 2: set(), 3: {1, 2}}
Now we visit 1 as it's first in our FIFO queue.
Looking at course 1's neighbors in our graph there's 3,
{0: {1, 2}, 1: {3}, 2: {3}}
but it has a prereq we haven't taken 2,
{0: set(), 1: set(), 2: set(), 3: {2}}
Which is still in our queue: deque([2])
So we don't add anything in this iter and then pop 2 from our q.
Now we've taken 2, we can hit 3 from our graph: 0: {1, 2}, 1: {3}, 2: {3}}
we have now taken 2 so we remove the prereq: {0: set(), 1: set(), 2: set(), 3: set()}
And we add 3 to the queue.
deque([3])
We then pop 3, append 3 to our taken list and len(taken) == numCourses so we're done!
